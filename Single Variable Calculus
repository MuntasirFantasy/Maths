Problem:
1. Find the tangent line to y=f(x) at P=(x0, y0) ?
Hint:
  f`(x0) is the derivative of f at x0, is the slope of the tangent line to y=f(x) at P.

2. Find areas of triangles enclosed by axes and the tangent to y=(1/x)?

Terminology:
1. Secant Line: A secant line is a straight line that intersect a curve at two or more distinct points.
2. Tangent Line: A tangent line touches the curve at exactly one point without touching it.


Limits & Continuity:
1. Left hand limit
2. Right hand limit

  The concept of left hand limit and right hand limit are concepts used to describe behavior of a function as it approaches a specific point from the left and the right.
